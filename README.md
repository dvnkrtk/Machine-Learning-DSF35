# Classification of Iris Dataset with Decision Tree

## Project Description
Building the best model to classify Iris flower species based on their physical characteristics through several machine learning prediction techniques is the main focus of this project. The Iris dataset is a benchmark dataset for machine learning classification. Presented are 150 samples of three iris species: Setoso, Versicolor, and Virginica, with four distinguishing characteristics (sepal and petal dimensions). This project aims to classify iris species with Decision Tree.

## Project with Decision Tree
Using real-world data and machine learning techniques, this project is about data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and implementation of classification models using Decision Tree, one of the simplest and most effective machine learning algorithms due to its better generalization capabilities . The success of the model in achieving high accuracy of 96% shows the power of this technique in solving classification problems with relatively simple data sets.
